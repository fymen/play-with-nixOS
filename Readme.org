Personal NixOS configuration.

Try to keep it straight and simple.

=make= to build this configuration without switch.

=make debug= is the same as =make=, but with more debug info and a colorized summary output powered by [[https://github.com/maralorn/nix-output-monitor][nix-output-monitor]].

=make install= to switch it.

=make clean= to dump garbage.

=make deploy= to deploy remote host.

I use Emacs as my primarily text Editor. I have used it for many years, and have developed my own personalized style for it. I find it difficult to switch to other text editors such as doom Emacs, Neovim or Vscode because I feel most comfortable with my vanilla Emacs.

I manage my Emacs configuration by [[https://github.com/nix-community/emacs-overlay][Emacs overlay]] now, it is not bad for now. The literal configure file is [[file:home/modules/emacs/emacs.org][emacs.org]]. There are also [[https://fengmao.netlify.app/build-extra-emacs-packages-by-nix/][some tips]] on moving Emacs configuration to Nix.

Emacs is a handy tool that you can do almost everything in it. So I don't invest too much on other tools, although some of them are really cool.
