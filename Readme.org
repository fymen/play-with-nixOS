Personal NixOS configuration.

Try to keep it straight and simple.

=make= to build this configuration without switch.

=make debug= is the as =make=, but with more debug info and a colorized summary out put powered by [[https://github.com/maralorn/nix-output-monitor][nix-output-monitor]].

=make install= to switch it.

=make clean= to dump garbage.

=make deploy= to deploy remote host.

I use Emacs as my primarily text Editor. I have used it for many years, and have developed my own personalized style for it. I find it difficult to switch to other text editors such as doom Emacs, Neovim or Vscode because I feel most comfortable with Emacs.

To ensure that I can easily update and modify my [[https://github.com/fymen/.emacs.d][Emacs dot files]], I have stored them in a separate repository.

Emacs is a handy tool that you can do almost everything in it. So I don't invest too much on other tools, although some of them are really cool.

* Emacs on Hyprland
#+attr_html: :width 800
[[file:samples/emacs-hyprland.jpg]]

Why [[https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs][zenburn]] ?

It may not be as fancy as other color themes such as [[https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin][Catppuccin]] or [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom Dracula]], but its low contrast color set is suitable for prolonged use.

* Todo
Support MacOS and standalone home-manager on other distribution.
